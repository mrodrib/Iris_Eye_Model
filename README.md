# Iris Eye Model

This project's objective has been to create an artificial intelligence model that helps in the identification of colors.

A [web application](https://github.com/mrodrib/Iris-Eye/) has also been created for its use.

A balanced dataset (70 images per class) of 11 colors has been used. (available in the repository)

# Specific info

We've used a Keras convolutional network optimized with Keras Tuner. As well as a callback function to get best weights training.

Best accuracy achieved was 0.9792.

The final model is composed of two 2D convolutional layers behind which there are reduction or max_pooling layers. 

Behind the convolutional layers is a flatten layer that performs the transformation of 3D matrices to 1D tensors that will be the input to the dense output layers, between which a dropout layer is placed (although in the final model the optimal dropout index is set to 0).

We can observe how the model during training adjusts rapidly from the first periods, without producing large oscillations or overfitting.

The roc (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows that the model performs very well in classifying the different colors.
This plot plots the false positive ratio (x-axis) against the false negative ratio (y-axis).

The confusion matrix of the model indicates that it has a high level of accuracy in classifying the different colors.

The main diagonal shows the correctly predicted images for each of the classes (colors) of the test set.
